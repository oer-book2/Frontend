      "Exploring Movie Construction & Production: What's so exciting about movies?",
    description:
      "Exploring Movie Construction & Production contains eight chapters of the major areas of film construction and production. The discussion covers theme, genre, narrative structure, character portrayal, story, plot, directing style, cinematography, and editing. Important terminology is defined and types of analysis are discussed and demonstrated.  An extended example of how a movie description reflects the setting, narrative structure, or directing style is used throughout the book to illustrate building blocks of each theme. This approach to film instruction and analysis has proved beneficial to increasing students' learning, while enhancing the creativity and critical thinking of the student.",

    title: "A First Course in Linear Algebra",
    description:
      "A First Course in Linear Algebra is an introductory textbook aimed at college-level sophomores and juniors. Typically students will have taken calculus, but it is not a prerequisite. The book begins with systems of linear equations, then covers matrix algebra, before taking up finite-dimensional vector spaces in full generality. The final chapter covers matrix representations of linear transformations, through diagonalization, change of basis and Jordan canonical form. Determinants and eigenvalues are covered along the way.",

    title: "American Environmental History",
    description:
      "Our goal is to deal with both events and ideas. But realistically, this is a survey of American Environmental History stretching from prehistory to the present. We're going to spend most of our time on events, especially because the environmental elements of many key events in American History are not well understood. Too often our stories about America's past devote all their attention to political debates and to the ideologies of elite leaders or philosophies of founding fathers, and these tales are told against a neutral background that isn't part of the story at all. The main goal of this text is to show that it's really not possible to understand our past while ignoring the environment.",
